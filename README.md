# How to run. 
1. Compile the code. 
```shell

``` 
This will automatically clean and recompile your code.   

2. run the server & client
Go to the directory where has run-server.sh and run-client.sh files, then run following commands.  
```shell 
./run-server.sh
```  
This will run a server and listen at port 8080. To see your local server running, go to "localhost:8080" in your browser.  

```shell

For example:  
```shell
./run-client.sh localhost:8080 ./ 1024  
```
it will return following stuff (with start code) 
```shell
Ping() successful
PutBlock() successful
GetBlock() successfully read in 16 bytes
``` 
And the server side will have following log print out:
```shell
